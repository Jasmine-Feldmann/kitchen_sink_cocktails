# Kitchen Sink Cocktails


This app is designed to help you find classic cocktail recipes based on what you currently have laying around your kitchen. The site uses Ruby on Rails as the backend, and a custom scraper to grab cocktail names and recipes from a site. With the resulting recipes, it helps users find a cocktail they might like by showing them any cocktail that contains searched ingredients.
