# Kitchen Sink Cocktails


This app is designed to help you find classic cocktail recipes based on what you currently have laying around your kitchen. The site uses Ruby on Rails as the backend, a custom scraper to grab cocktail names and recipes, and the Rails4-autocomplete gem to make searching the thousands of ingredients and cocktails easier. Users can filter lists by adding more ingredients, and browse how easy cocktails are to make using the provided legend, based on the number of total ingredients.
